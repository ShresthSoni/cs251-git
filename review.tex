\textbf{Performance}\\
All the actors have done a great job in in their respective roles, especially Gabbar. Amjad Khan has been spine chilling as well as a treat to watch as Gabbar. The dialogues are the life of this movie. Some of them even remembered today. Direction of Ramesh Sippy should be credited for this once in a lifetime movie.\\
